# Space-Invaders
Copy of the 2D game called Space Invaders. This was made using C#, Raylib and Raygui. 

# Controls
A and D to move, Space to shoot. The controls will be on the top left corner of the main menu once you run the program in case you forget them.

# NOTE 
The game is still under development and not finished. I am working on this and it should be done soon!
